# Learning-League-flask-project

It is a full stack web app of an education center. 

Front end is made using HTML & Bootstrap 4.5. 

Flask is used as a backend framework of python. 

Online heroku PostgreSQL database is connected to the app.

I used Stripe to implement a payment interface and also
implemented a confirmation email service using smtplib
library of python.

Stripe payment service is in test mode. So, only works with 4242 4242 4242 4242 as card number,any future expiry date and any CVV no.

It is deployed using heroku.
